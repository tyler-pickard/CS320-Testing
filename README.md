Java Testing



How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  I use the method of testing early and often.  It is best to fail fast and get the errors corrected early and often.  I work by writing one
  section or function at a time and then testing it before moving on.  This does not allow bugs to pile up and is much easier to address
  during the development phase.  This will also help make sure that tests can be written to cover the important functions during the process.
  If you wait until the end, then functions could be missed in testing.
  
  



How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  Once a user need is identified, that need should be added to a list of functions that are considered necessary.  All necessary functions
  must be met for the project to be successful.  it is very important to identify user needs early in the process and throughout the process if
  they change.  Establishing tests to challenge these needs will help make sure they are included and run as expected.





How do I approach designing software?


  I follow the agile approach of writing my software to the minimum of requirements that are provided by the client or project leader.  
  Writing to the minimum of requirments allows for all important functions to be met, but the programmer does not spend time adding 
  features that were not requested and may not add value in the user's opinion.  There is less wasted time on the project, while also
  making sure all features are met and keeping the code as simple as possible to limit mistakes and more updatable over time.
